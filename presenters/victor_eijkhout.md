Victor Eijkhout was brought up as a numerical analyst,
coding in Fortran, and proving theorems
about the asymptotic behavior of parallel numerical methods.
Having passed through a C~phase, these days he mostly writes in C++,
both sequential and parallel in various ways.
While he doesn't prove many theorems any more, he is still
interested in the matters of code performance for finite numbers of processors,
and code correctness.
He has been employed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center
for almost twenty years,
supporting research,
teaching various aspects of high performance computing, and
flexing his programming muscle on 100,000+ core supercomputers.
