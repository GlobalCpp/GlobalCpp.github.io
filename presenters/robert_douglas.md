Rob Douglas is the organizer of the Chicago C/C++ User Group, a 15+ year member of the C++ Standards Committee, currently over-committing himself as he sits out a garden leave, but always excited to help others move forward in their careers.

Rob has presented before several times, plus moderated panels and sat on panels for the group. He is excited to be working alongside other energetic and accomplished user group organizers with the help of some fantastic volunteers within this organization to get this new adventure off and running.
